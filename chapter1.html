                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fine morning in the year 1746 a ship set sail Pondicherry in India. Captain A. Bitto and his crew,
                 though sad to bid farewell to the shores of France were excited at the prospect of visiting new lands
                 and shores.
             </div>

             <div class="row">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship was a passenger liner carrying also a lot of jewels and other riches.
                Most important was a toll bell presented by the ecclesiastical authority of France.The ship changed
                 course from Calcutta and moved towards Chandipur port in Orissa where a few passengers were to alight.
                 At a distance could be seen the mouth of the River Mahanadi.

           <div class="row">
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ship started southwards, and all on board were gay and happy. Maitee, a youth,
               forming part of the crew had his eyes moving around looking through the telescope. Suddenly the lens
                focused on a huge form, rushing towards the ship with unspeakable frightening speed. The animal, a
                whale, was mammoth in size, its mouth large enough to swallow a ship. Its tail lashing around wildly,
                appeared like a big sheet of shining blade, powerful enough to slash the ship into tiny pieces.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="row">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a moment’s loss he rushed to the Captain and informed
             him of the approaching danger. The Captain looked up from his study of the map, right
              into the flushed and nervous face of Maitee. The latter silently handed over the telescope
              and the former saw the approaching danger for himself. But behold ! a little distance
              further down from the whale, there was something else approaching too.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="row">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was no animal nor fish, but an angry, violent
             storm approaching at a breakneck speed . This was also the cause of the whale
              hurrying towards the ship. Captain Bitto could see at a distance , the sea
              raging on all sides like an angry foamy white mountain. The horizon and the
              sky were lost to the view, so high was the rise of the furious sea water .
               The sky was but a black canopy of thundering and protesting clouds .
               Lightning struck through , for a moment breaking through  the thick black clouds.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="row">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain was perplexed . For a moment he thought
              to order for abandonment of the ship. A minute later he realized that it
              would be futile effort for safety as the sea would engulf them in a minute.
               The ship was, as it were just between two dangerously pointed horns of a
               bull, escape on either side was impossible. The predicament was clear,
              but it was  for them to wait and see which would get them first— whale or storm .
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="row">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maitee also closely observed the speed of the storm with
             the telescope. The water column was rising higher  and higher and appeared like
             one unsurmountable pillar. Even a big whale frightened by its typhonic speed left
             its den and rushed out. The Captain’s mind was restless with worry. He was sure
             that the whale would devour them even before the storm. He was all the more anxious
             for the safety of his crew. At last he decided to ring the danger bell so that
            all should rush up to the deck. He cried out …

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My dear friends, I have an evil news for you.
             The sea will soon be our grave or we will be crushed within the dark tunnel
             of the whale’s stomach. There is a big whale approaching us closely followed
             by an angry looking storm. Either the ship will be devoured or get wrecked.
             There is no escape. I cannot help you or console you but only advise you to
             call upon the supreme Being before the close of life”.

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All-around he was surrounded by his passengers.
             There was a perfect silence on board, disturned only by the roar of the
             storm. Bitto felt he would go mad any moment. What could he do to help
             others when he was himself but a tossing toy in the hands of destiny? Helpless,
             he looked at others, tears running down his cheeks. Despair and despondency
             reigned supreme amongst the crew.

          <br>
          <div class="row">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hue and cry, and the crew rushed
              around to try to save themselves at the last-hour. The Captain too rushed
              into action. As he rushed about, he came near a man at the corner. Unlike
              others he was calm and there was no sign of anxiety in him. In his hand he
              held a photograph and his eyes were fixed at the same.On closer view the captain
              saw it to be a snapshot of three figures. one white, the middle yellow
              and the last one black. This old man was muttering something, looking
              at the picture.
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="row">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captain put an arm around this man and asked.
              “What are you doing at this impending hour of danger? Will this photograph
               save you from the approaching danger, O Saudagar ? Nay, nothing can save
               us now, we are doomed.”
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="row">
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tremble passed through the ship. The whale was
             now clearly visible at a short distance. The captain’s eyes fell on the
             terrifying hooded eyes of the whale. He felt his heart-beat and his warm
             blood turn cold. He turned away from this horrifying sight to rush up once
             again. Time and again, on his rounds he bumped into the old man with the
             picture. It appeared as though he was speaking softly and tenderly to the
             figures in the snap

             of the man, came closer, to view it once again. He was nonplussed for a moment.
             The Black figure of the photo looked more terrifying than the whale. The round
             eyes were more brilliantly frightening than those of the huge fish.

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am invoking my Lord Jagannath’s blessings for our safety.”
             To this simple and straight forward reply the captain questioned. <br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Jagannath ! Well who is he please ? What can he do
             in this predicament of ours ? Can he destroy the whale with his weapons and save

             could reach His ears in time there is no doubt that He will come to our rescue.
             Only our sincere devotion can move Him. I have a strong belief that our safety is a

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He exclaimed O’Lord ! The whale has changed its course.
             It is moving away from use, heading in the opposite direction.The whale’s eyes are
             now wide open and its movements slow and lethargic. All around there was a momentary
             hope and they heaved a sigh of relief, but the other danger was still lurking at a
             close distance. The storm had not abated an inch. Before the captain’s eyes flashed
             the picture of our Black Magician and before he could realise what he was doing,
             the Saudagar prayed fervently .

              With this the force of the storm gradually died down till it was completely quiet.

             was a sudden row-de-dow. The captain lifted his hand for silence and proclaimed that
             they were saved because of the mercy of the great Lord at Puri. At once he rushed to
             the Old Oriya man Kuladsagar of village Pipli. He embraced him and expressing his gratitude
             said :---<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Well, my man, you showed us the way to safety. Your prayers reached the Lord’s ears
             in time. Thank you my dear Sir; Your faith and sincerity are all consuming.
             May I see the photograph once closely ?”
             <br>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To his surprise the Black figure was smiling now. The face had a benign look, mercy
             and love shining out of His eyes”.Bitto could not speak at this change. All this was
             a miracle and a Divine Miracle.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the ship reached Puri he expressed his gratitude to Lord Jagannath(our Jaguni).
             All his stores were carried to the Lions’ Gate at the Puri temple including the bell meant for the church of Pondicherry.

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bell is still to be found in the Jagannath
             Temple at Puri (Niladri Bihar). Although the French Government requested the
             Indian Ministry to return this bell, their request was not entertained by the
             Mukti Mandap Sabha since it was a ‘Dana’ and once a gift is offered to
             <b>our Black Magician</b> and accepted by Him it cannot be returned. On the
             bell are graved in french, the words : <br><br><br>
             <b>“ IA II BERALITE’ DEPEDRO MOUDELI COURT, DELA COMP, DE FRANCE ME NOMME PIERRE
