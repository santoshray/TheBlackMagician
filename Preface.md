# Preface 

It is an old custom that the people on car-festival days, observe the
'Nabadina Brata'. One night while the Lord was still in the car on Bada-Danda,
the author with some of his friends slept near the car as usual. In a dream he found
that in an empty room there stood a wooden stool on which a book was placed. 
On the cover page were found the words **"Our Black Magician"** in bold letters. He did not touch it , nor did he try to know the contents. Due to a slight shower of rain his sleep was broken and dream ended. 

To satisfy his curosity he enquired at the Railway Station book shops at Puri, Khurda Road, Cuttack and even at Calcutta for such a book. Every where he was told there was no such book . This led him to think that "Black Magician" was none but the Lord on the car, to ceremonise the car festival. 

	This book is the result of the dream by the author
